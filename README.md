# Weather Locator

## Description
- Weather Dashboard is a platform that allows users to search for a city and obtain the current weather conditions and five day forecast. Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap and Open Weather API.

## User Story
- As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly. When I search for a city, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. 
When I view current weather conditions for that city, I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
When I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
When I click on a city in the search history, I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
